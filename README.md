=======================
Arnold RV Driver
=======================

This is a driver for sending Arnold AOVs to RV.

It uses boost asio for communicating with RV over sockets.

Tweak software support says that earlier memory leak issue in RV 4.0.10 is now fixed with several users confirming it.

All I ask is that if you do improve it, please fork and commit your changes back to github.
